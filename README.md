# Bias Mitigation for Medical Images

In this project, we investigate how bias in machine learning models, particularly those used in medical image analysis, can lead to unfair outcomes across various demographic subgroups. We focus on chest radiograph datasets and highlight the necessity of fairness in medical AI, especially considering the significant implications bias can have on healthcare decisions.
